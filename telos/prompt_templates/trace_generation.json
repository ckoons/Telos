For each requirement, identify which implementation artifacts (if any) fulfill or partially fulfill that requirement.\n\nProvide the following in your analysis:\n\n1. **Direct Traces**:\n   - For each requirement, list the artifact(s) that directly implement it\n   - Explain how the artifact fulfills the requirement\n   - Note any partial implementations\n\n2. **Gap Analysis**:\n   - Identify any requirements without corresponding implementation artifacts\n   - Suggest what types of artifacts would be needed to fulfill these requirements\n\n3. **Verification Approach**:\n   - For each trace, suggest a verification method to confirm the requirement is properly implemented\n   - This could include test cases, code reviews, or other verification techniques\n\nFormat your response as follows:\n\n### Requirement [ID]: [Requirement Summary]\n\n**Traced To**:\n- Artifact [ID/Name]: [Brief explanation of how this artifact implements the requirement]\n- Artifact [ID/Name]: [Brief explanation of how this artifact implements the requirement]\n\n**Verification Method**:\n[Suggested approach to verify this implementation]\n\n**Gaps**:\n[Any aspects of the requirement not covered by current artifacts]\n\n---\n\nAfter analyzing all requirements, provide a summary of overall traceability coverage and recommendations for improving traceability in the project.",
